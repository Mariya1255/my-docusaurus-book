# Module 1: Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the first module of our book on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This module will provide a comprehensive introduction to the exciting world of intelligent robots that can physically interact with their environment.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing intelligent agents that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world. Unlike traditional AI, which is often confined to the digital realm, Physical AI deals with the challenges of embodiment, perception, and interaction.

## The Rise of Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robotics is a subfield of robotics that deals with the design, construction, and operation of robots with a human-like form and capabilities. The humanoid form is particularly interesting because it allows robots to operate in human-centric environments and interact with tools and systems designed for humans.

## Key Topics Covered

In this module, you will learn about:

- The history and evolution of humanoid robotics.
- The fundamental concepts of Physical AI.
- The key hardware and software components of a humanoid robot.
- The ethical and societal implications of humanoid robotics.

By the end of this module, you will have a solid understanding of the foundations of Physical AI and humanoid robotics, which will prepare you for the more advanced topics in the subsequent modules.
