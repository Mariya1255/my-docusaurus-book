# Module 2: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module introduces the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), an open-source set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications. ROS 2 is the de facto standard for robotics middleware, providing services like hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management.

## Why ROS 2?

ROS 2 is a significant evolution of ROS 1, designed to address the needs of modern robotics applications, including:

-   **Real-time support:** For applications requiring precise timing and control.
-   **Multi-robot systems:** For coordinating multiple robots.
-   **Small embedded systems:** For resource-constrained devices.
-   **Unreliable networks:** For robust communication in challenging environments.

## Core Concepts of ROS 2

In this module, you will learn about the fundamental concepts of ROS 2:

-   **Nodes:** The main computational units in ROS 2. Each node is a process that performs a specific task.
-   **Topics:** Named buses over which nodes exchange messages.
-   **Services:** A request/reply communication model.
-   **Actions:** For long-running tasks that provide feedback.
-   **Parameters:** For configuring nodes at runtime.
-   **Launch Files:** For starting and configuring multiple nodes.

## Hands-on with ROS 2

This module will guide you through setting up a ROS 2 development environment and creating your first ROS 2 application. You will learn how to write nodes, publish and subscribe to topics, and use services and actions.

By the end of this module, you will be proficient in using ROS 2 to build and manage complex robot applications.
