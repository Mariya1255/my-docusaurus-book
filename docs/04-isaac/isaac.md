# Module 4: NVIDIA Isaac SDK

NVIDIA Isaac is a powerful open-source robotics platform for developing and deploying AI-powered robots. The Isaac SDK includes a collection of libraries, tools, and hardware-accelerated modules that can be used to build a wide range of robotics applications, from simple mobile robots to complex humanoid robots.

## Key Features of NVIDIA Isaac

-   **Isaac Sim:** A photorealistic, physically-accurate virtual environment for developing, testing, and training AI-based robots.
-   **Isaac Gym:** A high-performance reinforcement learning framework for training policies in simulation.
-   **Isaac ROS:** A collection of hardware-accelerated packages for ROS 2 that provide optimized performance for NVIDIA GPUs and Jetson platforms.
-   **Isaac Cortex:** A decision-making framework for autonomous robots that uses a behavior-based architecture.

## Building with Isaac

This module will provide a hands-on introduction to the NVIDIA Isaac SDK. You will learn how to:

-   Set up an Isaac development environment.
-   Use Isaac Sim to create and simulate a robot.
-   Train a reinforcement learning agent using Isaac Gym.
-   Integrate Isaac ROS packages into a ROS 2 application.

## Isaac for Humanoid Robotics

NVIDIA Isaac is particularly well-suited for humanoid robotics due to its advanced simulation capabilities and its support for a wide range of sensors and actuators. This module will explore how Isaac can be used to develop and test control algorithms for humanoid robots, including walking, grasping, and manipulation.

By the end of this module, you will have the skills to build and deploy sophisticated AI-powered robots using the NVIDIA Isaac SDK.
