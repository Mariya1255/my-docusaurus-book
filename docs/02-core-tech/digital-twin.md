# II. The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This chapter explores the concept and implementation of "Digital Twins" in robotics, focusing on high-fidelity simulation environments like Gazebo and Unity. A digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical system, offering a powerful platform for design, testing, and validation of robotic systems in a cost-effective and safe manner.

We will cover the creation of realistic virtual environments, modeling robot kinematics and dynamics, and integrating various sensors (e.g., cameras, LiDAR, force sensors) within both Gazebo and Unity. The chapter will also detail how these digital twins can be interfaced with external control systems, including ROS 2, to facilitate the development and refinement of complex robotic behaviors and AI algorithms before deployment to physical hardware.
