# I. The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This chapter introduces the Robot Operating System (ROS 2) as the foundational framework for building modular and communicative robot behaviors. We will explore its architecture, key concepts like nodes, topics, services, and actions, and how to set up a ROS 2 workspace. Practical examples will guide you through publishing sensor data, subscribing to control commands, and orchestrating complex robotic tasks.

A significant portion of this chapter is dedicated to **ROS 2 simulation**. We will demonstrate how to integrate ROS 2 with popular simulation environments to test and validate robotic algorithms in a virtual setting before deploying to physical hardware. Topics include setting up simulated robots, interfacing with virtual sensors, and controlling robot behaviors within a simulated world, enabling rapid prototyping and iterative development.
