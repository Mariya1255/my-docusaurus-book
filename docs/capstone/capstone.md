# Capstone Project: Building a Humanoid Robot Application

The Capstone Project is the culmination of your learning journey in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. In this project, you will apply all the knowledge and skills you have acquired throughout the course to design, implement, and evaluate a real-world humanoid robot application.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of the Capstone Project are to:

-   Integrate various components of Physical AI and robotics, including perception, control, and decision-making.
-   Develop a practical application that addresses a real-world problem or demonstrates a novel capability.
-   Work in a team to foster collaboration and problem-solving skills.
-   Present your project effectively, showcasing your technical and communication skills.

## Project Phases

The Capstone Project will typically involve the following phases:

1.  **Project Proposal:** Define the problem, propose a solution, and outline the project scope, objectives, and deliverables.
2.  **Design and Planning:** Develop a detailed design for your robot application, including hardware and software architectures, algorithms, and experimental procedures.
3.  **Implementation:** Build and integrate the hardware and software components of your robot application.
4.  **Testing and Evaluation:** Rigorously test your robot application, analyze its performance, and evaluate its effectiveness against your defined objectives.
5.  **Documentation and Presentation:** Prepare a comprehensive project report and deliver a compelling presentation of your work.

## Potential Project Ideas

Here are some example project ideas to inspire you:

-   A humanoid robot performing domestic tasks (e.g., fetching objects, cleaning).
-   A humanoid robot assisting in a healthcare setting (e.g., guiding patients, delivering medication).
-   A humanoid robot for education or entertainment (e.g., teaching, storytelling).
-   A humanoid robot exploring unknown environments and building maps.

You are encouraged to propose your own innovative project ideas that align with your interests and the course objectives.
