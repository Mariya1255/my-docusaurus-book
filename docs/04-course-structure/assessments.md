# VIII. Assessments

This chapter outlines the comprehensive assessment strategy designed to evaluate students' understanding and application of the concepts presented in this book. Our approach to assessments is multi-faceted, aiming to measure both theoretical knowledge and practical skill development in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

Assessments will include a combination of quizzes to test foundational understanding, programming assignments focusing on ROS 2 and simulation environments, and a final project that challenges students to integrate various learned topics into a functional robotic system. Details regarding grading criteria, submission guidelines, and due dates for each assessment component will be provided, ensuring clarity and fairness in evaluating student progress.
