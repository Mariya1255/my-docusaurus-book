# IX. Hardware Requirements

This chapter details the recommended and essential hardware components necessary to fully engage with the practical exercises and projects outlined in this book. While many concepts can be explored through simulation, hands-on experience with physical systems is invaluable for understanding the nuances of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

We will cover specifications for development boards (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson series), robotic platforms (e.g., specific humanoid robot kits or open-source designs), sensors (e.g., cameras, LiDAR, IMUs), and computational peripherals. Guidance will be provided on selecting appropriate hardware based on budget, performance needs, and project complexity, along with tips for setup and basic maintenance.
