# V. Why Physical AI Matters

This chapter explores the fundamental reasons why Physical AI is a crucial and rapidly evolving field. We delve into the limitations of purely software-based AI systems and highlight how embodiment and real-world interaction are essential for developing truly intelligent, adaptable, and robust agents.

We will examine case studies and theoretical frameworks that underscore the significance of physical presence in AI development. Topics covered include the challenges of sim-to-real transfer, the role of sensory-motor contingencies in learning, and how embodied AI can lead to more intuitive human-robot collaboration and problem-solving in unstructured environments.
