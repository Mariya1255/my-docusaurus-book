In this chapter, we delve into two fundamental concepts crucial for modern humanoid robotics: ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) and Digital Twins.

**ROS2** provides a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behaviors across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

**Digital Twins** are virtual models designed to accurately reflect a physical object. In robotics, a digital twin of a humanoid robot can simulate its behavior, test new algorithms, and predict performance without risking damage to the actual hardware. This is invaluable for development, testing, and maintenance.

Understanding these technologies is key to developing advanced humanoid robot systems.
