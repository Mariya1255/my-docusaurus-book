# ADR-001: Docusaurus Book Architecture and Deployment

> **Scope**: Document decision clusters, not individual technology choices. Group related decisions that work together (e.g., "Frontend Stack" not separate ADRs for framework, styling, deployment).

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-12-08
- **Feature:** 001-docusaurus-book-structure
- **Context:** The project requires building an open-source book titled "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" with 9 distinct modules/chapters. The primary goal is to create a maintainable, navigable, and easily deployable online book platform. The platform needs to support markdown content, automated sidebar generation, and GitHub Pages deployment.

<!-- Significance checklist (ALL must be true to justify this ADR)
     1) Impact: Long-term consequence for architecture/platform/security?
     2) Alternatives: Multiple viable options considered with tradeoffs?
     3) Scope: Cross-cutting concern (not an isolated detail)?
     If any are false, prefer capturing as a PHR note instead of an ADR. -->

## Decision

*   **Static Site Generator**: Docusaurus (v2+)
*   **Content Structure**: 9 modules, each corresponding to a chapter, represented as top-level directories within `book/docs/`. Each module directory contains an `_category_.json` for sidebar configuration and `index.md` for introductory content, along with other `.md` files for sections.
*   **Sidebar Navigation**: Auto-generated based on the `docs` directory structure using Docusaurus's `autogenerated` sidebar type.
*   **Content Format**: Markdown (`.md` or `.mdx`) for all book content.
*   **Deployment Platform**: GitHub Pages.
*   **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated build and deployment upon pushes to the `main` branch.

## Consequences

### Positive

*   **Ease of Maintenance**: Docusaurus simplifies content management and site generation.
*   **Automated Navigation**: Auto-generated sidebars reduce manual configuration effort and errors.
*   **Version Control Integration**: Markdown content and GitHub Pages facilitate collaborative development and versioning.
*   **Cost-Effective Deployment**: GitHub Pages provides free, reliable hosting for static sites.
*   **Good Developer Experience (DX)**: Docusaurus provides good tooling and development server for content authors.

### Negative

*   **Docusaurus Lock-in**: Migrating to a different static site generator would require re-configuring project structure and potentially some content adaptation.
*   **GitHub Pages Limitations**: Limited dynamic capabilities; relies on client-side JavaScript for interactivity beyond static content.

## Alternatives Considered

*   **Alternative Static Site Generators**:
    *   **Gatsby**: Offers more flexibility with GraphQL data layer, but has a steeper learning curve and potentially higher build times for simple documentation sites. Rejected due to increased complexity for this specific project's needs.
    *   **Jekyll**: A simpler Ruby-based static site generator. Rejected due to less native support for documentation features (like versioning, search, I18n) compared to Docusaurus and potentially less active community for documentation-focused sites.
*   **Alternative Deployment**:
    *   **Netlify/Vercel**: Could offer more advanced CI/CD features and custom domains, but GitHub Pages is sufficient and integrated with the project's source control. Rejected for simplicity and direct integration with GitHub.
