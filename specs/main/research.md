# Research for Docusaurus Book Structure

**Date**: 2025-12-08

This document summarizes research findings for setting up and deploying the Docusaurus book project.

## 1. Sidebar Generation

### Decision
We will use Docusaurus's built-in automatic sidebar generation feature.

### Rationale
This approach is highly efficient and maintainable. It automatically creates a sidebar structure that mirrors the `docs` directory structure. This means that to create, reorder, or nest chapters, we only need to manage files and folders, without manually updating a configuration file.

### Implementation
- In `sidebars.js`, we will define the main sidebar with the type `autogenerated` and point it to the root of the docs directory (`dirName: '.'`).
- The order of items can be controlled using the `sidebar_position` front matter in each markdown file.
- The directory structure proposed in `plan.md` is compatible with this approach. Each module will be a top-level category.

## 2. Deployment to GitHub Pages

### Decision
The Docusaurus site will be deployed to GitHub Pages using the `npm run deploy` command and GitHub Actions for continuous deployment.

### Rationale
Docusaurus has first-class support for deploying to GitHub Pages. This method is well-documented, reliable, and straightforward to set up. Using GitHub Actions will automate the deployment process, ensuring the live book is always in sync with the main branch.

### Implementation
1.  **Configuration**: The `docusaurus.config.js` file will be updated with the correct `url`, `baseUrl`, `organizationName`, and `projectName` for the target GitHub repository.
2.  **Deployment Command**: The `npm run deploy` command, which uses the `gh-pages` package, will be used to build and push the static site to a `gh-pages` branch.
3.  **CI/CD**: A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) will be created to automate the deployment on every push to the `main` branch.
4.  **GitHub Pages Settings**: The repository settings will be configured to serve the site from the `gh-pages` branch.
